## Coffee Shop vs. Coffee Cart: Which for Your Westfield Chadstone Event?

Events near Westfield Chadstone face a unique choice: established café catering (like Coffee Culture Café) versus mobile coffee carts. Each approach has distinct advantages:

**Choose café catering when:**
- Your event needs the credibility of an established Westfield brand
- You're hosting recurring corporate events with the same vendor
- Guest count is moderate (20-100) and timing is flexible
- You want the reliability of a permanent business with reputation to maintain

**Choose mobile coffee carts when:**
- Your event location doesn't have nearby cafés (outdoor venues, parks)
- You need custom branding and presentation for product launches
- Guest count is high (100+) requiring dedicated high-volume equipment
- You want flexible service timing (early morning, late evening)
- Event requires photogenic cart as part of aesthetic

**Hybrid approach:** Some Westfield Chadstone events use café catering for intimate VIP areas and mobile carts for main guest service—combining established credibility with scalable volume.
