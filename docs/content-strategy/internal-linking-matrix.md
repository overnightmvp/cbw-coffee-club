## Implementation Notes

**Payload CMS Integration:**
1. Use the `internalLinks` relationship field in Posts collection
2. When creating each post, link to the posts listed in this matrix
3. Payload will generate proper internal links with post IDs
4. RichTextRenderer will convert relationship links to Next.js Link components

**Progressive Publication:**
- Publish location guides first (high authority hubs)
- Then publish spotlights (link to location guides)
- Then publish how-to guides (link to both)
- Finally publish education posts (complete the funnel)

**Link Maintenance:**
- Review link performance monthly via Google Analytics
- Update high-performing posts with additional internal links
- Add new posts to this matrix as Phase 2 and 3 content is created
