# Brew Hub: Third-Wave Coffee & Co-Working Space Near Chadstone

In an era where coffee shops are becoming offices and offices are adding coffee programs, Brew Hub occupies the intersection: a third-wave specialty coffee café near Chadstone that functions as both premium coffee destination and professional co-working space. With 35 seats, meeting rooms available for hire, and catering services for corporate teams and creative collaborators, Brew Hub has become the go-to space for professionals who refuse to compromise on either coffee quality or workspace functionality.

What distinguishes Brew Hub from traditional cafés is intentional design for hybrid use. The coffee program is serious—single-origin espressos, pour-over options, precise extraction, and baristas who can discuss terroir and processing methods. But the space is equally thoughtful about work requirements: reliable WiFi, power outlets at every table, quiet zones for focused work, meeting rooms for team sessions, and flexible catering options for groups gathering to brainstorm, strategize, or simply work together in a space that inspires rather than drains.

## About Brew Hub

Brew Hub was founded on a simple observation: Melbourne's knowledge workers and creative professionals were trapped between two unsatisfying options. Co-working spaces offered functionality but often terrible coffee. Specialty cafés offered exceptional coffee but discouraged laptop use or lacked professional amenities. Brew Hub asked: why not both?

The business model deliberately blurs boundaries between café, co-working space, and corporate meeting venue. **Walk-in customers** come for specialty coffee and stay because the environment supports productive work. **Remote workers and freelancers** become regulars, treating Brew Hub as their daily office and consuming multiple coffees throughout the day. **Corporate teams** book meeting rooms for brainstorming sessions, client meetings, or off-site strategic planning, with coffee service integrated seamlessly into their workspace hire.

This hybrid model creates interesting dynamics. The walk-in coffee business provides energy and street-level appeal. The co-working and remote worker regulars provide reliable weekday revenue and community atmosphere. The corporate catering and meeting room bookings provide higher-value transactions and expand revenue beyond retail coffee pricing.

Located near Chadstone (specific address pending verification), Brew Hub's positioning serves multiple customer segments: Chadstone retail workers taking quality coffee breaks, corporate employees from nearby office parks seeking better environments than their workplace break rooms, small business owners needing professional meeting spaces without WeWork-scale commitments, and freelancers wanting café atmosphere with explicit permission to work for hours.

The physical space reflects dual purpose. The coffee bar features top-tier equipment—commercial espresso machine with PID temperature control, multiple grinders for espresso and filter options, pour-over stations, and cold brew on tap. The seating is zoned: bar seating for quick coffee and social interaction, communal tables for collaborative work, quiet corner tables for focused individual work, and dedicated meeting rooms (bookable separately) for private team sessions.

Meeting rooms are equipped for professional use: whiteboards, HDMI-connected displays for laptop presentations, quality video conferencing equipment, and most importantly, in-room coffee service that doesn't require leaving to refill during long strategy sessions.

## Menu & Offerings

Brew Hub's coffee menu reflects third-wave specialty café standards with options that cater to both coffee enthusiasts and pragmatic daily drinkers.

**Espresso program** centers on rotating single-origin beans from respected specialty roasters across Melbourne and regional Victoria. The current espresso might be an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe with floral jasmine notes, while next month features a Colombian Geisha varietal with complex fruit acidity. For customers preferring consistency, a house blend is always available—a balanced medium roast that performs reliably in milk-based drinks.

Standard espresso menu includes: espressos, macchiatos, cortados, flat whites, cappuccinos, lattes, long blacks, and piccolos. Each is prepared with precision—proper dosing, timed extraction, milk steamed to specific temperatures based on drink type, and presentation that reflects care without pretension.

**Filter coffee options** appeal to lighter-roast enthusiasts. Pour-over service using V60, Chemex, or Kalita Wave brewing methods (choice based on bean characteristics) takes 4-5 minutes but delivers nuanced cups that showcase single-origin qualities. Batch filter coffee runs throughout the day for customers wanting quality filter coffee at espresso service speeds. Cold brew on tap during warmer months provides smooth, low-acid refreshment.

**Specialty drinks** expand beyond pure coffee: matcha lattes using ceremonial-grade Japanese matcha, chai lattes from house-blended spices, turmeric lattes with local honey and black pepper, and hot chocolate using single-origin cacao. These options serve non-coffee drinkers in co-working and meeting contexts without forcing compromise to commodity alternatives.

**Food program** supports all-day workspace use: breakfast options (avocado toast, granola bowls, bacon and egg rolls) for morning arrivals, substantial lunch items (gourmet sandwiches, salad bowls, grain bowls) for midday breaks, and all-day snacks (protein balls, house-baked muffins, fruit and nut bars) for sustained energy during long work sessions.

**Corporate catering packages** for meeting room bookings include:
- **Basic coffee service**: Batch filter coffee and tea, served buffet-style in meeting room
- **Barista service**: Dedicated barista taking orders during breaks, espresso drinks made to order
- **Full catering**: Coffee service plus food (morning tea platters, working lunch options)

Walk-in pricing ranges $4.80-7.00 AUD per cup, positioning Brew Hub at specialty café standards. Espressos and filter coffees trend lower ($4.80-5.50), milk-based drinks mid-range ($5.50-6.50), and specialty single-origin pour-overs at premium ($7.00). Meeting room hire is separate, typically $35-50/hour with coffee service packages adding $10-25 per person depending on service level.

## Pricing & Capacity

Walk-in coffee pricing reflects Brew Hub's third-wave positioning: quality beans cost more, skilled baristas command fair wages, and specialized equipment requires investment. Customers choosing Brew Hub over commodity cafés understand they're paying for coffee that rivals Melbourne's best specialty shops.

**Co-working day passes** ($25-35) include unlimited batch filter coffee and tea, reserved workspace, WiFi access, and power outlets—effectively amortizing coffee costs across the day while providing workspace value. Regular co-workers often purchase monthly passes ($200-300) that work out to under $15/day, making Brew Hub economically competitive with standalone co-working spaces that charge more but provide inferior coffee.

**Meeting room bookings** start at $35/hour for the small room (seats 4-6) up to $75/hour for the larger room (seats 10-12). These rates include room use, WiFi, presentation equipment, and whiteboards. Coffee service is added optionally:
- **Basic service** ($10/person): Batch filter coffee and tea, self-serve
- **Barista service** ($18/person): Made-to-order espresso drinks during scheduled breaks
- **Full catering** ($25-40/person): Coffee service plus food (morning tea or working lunch)

Corporate teams booking half-day strategy sessions (4 hours) with full catering typically invest $500-800 total (room hire + catering for 6-10 people)—competitive with hotel meeting room rates but with vastly superior coffee and more inspiring atmosphere.

**Capacity for events and catering** is limited by physical space. The café seats 35 total; meeting rooms accommodate 4-12 depending on room choice. For corporate teams wanting to book the entire café for exclusive use (team off-sites, company brainstorming days), Brew Hub offers full-venue hire (rates vary by day/time, typically $800-1,500 for half-day exclusive use) including dedicated coffee and food service for groups up to 30-35.

The catering capacity is conservatively 15-80 guests depending on service model. Small team meetings (6-12 people) get personalized barista service. Larger exclusive venue bookings (25-35 people) work best with combination barista service plus self-serve batch coffee station to manage flow.

## Why Choose Brew Hub for Your Event

Event suitability centers on **corporate team meetings** where environment matters as much as logistics. Teams escaping sterile office meeting rooms for strategic planning, brainstorming sessions, or quarterly retrospectives benefit from Brew Hub's inspiring atmosphere—exposed brick, natural light, creative energy from other co-workers, and coffee that fuels thinking rather than just maintaining wakefulness.

**Small business and startup teams** without dedicated office space use Brew Hub for regular team gatherings, client meetings, or investor pitches where professionalism matters but corporate meeting rooms feel too formal or expensive. The café setting reduces formality while maintaining quality—useful for creative industry meetings or early-stage startup pitches to angel investors.

**Creative collaborations**—designers meeting clients, writers workshopping projects, consultants conducting discovery sessions—benefit from Brew Hub's hybrid café/workspace atmosphere. The environment signals "creative professional" rather than "corporate rigid," useful when first impressions matter.

**Training and workshop sessions** for small groups (under 20) work well when structured as half-day bookings combining meeting room time with break sessions in the café proper. Leadership coaching, professional development workshops, or skill-sharing sessions gain energy from Brew Hub's learning-oriented atmosphere (other co-workers are visibly engaged in productive work, creating ambient motivation).

The **café vs. traditional meeting venue** decision matters. Traditional hotel or office meeting rooms feel transactional—you're there for the meeting, not the experience. Brew Hub integrates work and café culture, creating meetings that feel energizing rather than draining. For teams in knowledge industries where environment affects creative output, this psychological shift has real value.

Barista quality and coffee knowledge enhance the experience. Brew Hub's baristas can discuss coffee origins, suggest brew methods based on preference, and adjust drinks to individual tastes—making coffee breaks genuinely enjoyable rather than just functional. For teams spending 4+ hours together, multiple quality coffee breaks improve meeting satisfaction substantially.

Customer testimonials emphasize workspace quality, WiFi reliability, coffee consistency, and atmosphere conducive to productive work—the fundamentals that matter for hybrid café/workspace use. Corporate clients praise the professionalism of meeting room setup and responsive service during catered sessions.

## How to Book Brew Hub

Booking Brew Hub for corporate meetings or catered events starts with contact at hello@brewhubchadstone.com.au (pending verification) or visiting in person to speak with management. Corporate planners should provide: preferred date and time, expected group size, meeting duration (2 hours, half-day, full-day), and service level needed (meeting room only, basic coffee, barista service, full catering).

Lead time for bookings should be 2-3 weeks minimum for small meetings, extending to 4-6 weeks for exclusive venue hire or custom catering requirements. Brew Hub's meeting rooms book regularly with returning corporate clients, so early contact secures preferred dates.

The quote process involves space consultation: Brew Hub's team will recommend appropriate room sizing based on your group, discuss coffee service options based on meeting duration and break patterns, and suggest food catering if your session spans meal times. They'll provide detailed written quotes breaking down room hire, coffee service per person, food catering costs, and total investment.

Pre-event coordination includes: confirming AV requirements (do you need HDMI, video conferencing, specific tech?), dietary needs (dairy alternatives, gluten-free, vegan options), timing preferences (when should coffee be ready, how to structure breaks), and logistics (where should your team enter, where to park, what time can you access the room for setup).

Day-of service is professional but unpretentious. Brew Hub staff will have your room prepared, coffee service ready at scheduled times, and a point person available for any adjustments needed during your session. Unlike large venues where you're one of many bookings, Brew Hub's smaller scale means personalized attention.

For recurring bookings (monthly team strategy days, quarterly board meetings, regular client workshop series), Brew Hub offers package arrangements that simplify scheduling and often provide pricing advantages for committed clients.
