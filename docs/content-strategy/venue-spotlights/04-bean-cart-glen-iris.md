# Bean & Cart Co.: Organic Single-Origin Coffee Cart in Glen Iris

When your wedding or upscale event demands more than just good coffee—when sustainability, ethical sourcing, and exceptional quality all matter—Bean & Cart Co. has built a devoted following across Glen Iris, Ashburton, Camberwell, Malvern, and Toorak by doing coffee service differently. Specializing in organic single-origin beans and sustainable practices, they've become the preferred choice for couples planning eco-conscious weddings, corporate clients with ESG commitments, and event organizers who understand that every detail, including coffee service, reflects their values.

What sets Bean & Cart Co. apart isn't just organic beans or compostable cups—plenty of vendors offer those as add-ons. It's their holistic approach to sustainable coffee service: beans are direct-trade and certified organic, equipment runs on renewable energy where possible, waste is minimized through thoughtful logistics, and the entire service is designed to complement events where environmental consciousness matters. For couples getting married in Glen Iris's heritage gardens or corporates hosting sustainability summits in Malvern, Bean & Cart Co. delivers coffee that aligns with your event's ethos.

## About Bean & Cart Co.

Bean & Cart Co. was founded by coffee professionals who saw a disconnect between Melbourne's thriving specialty coffee scene and the event catering industry's often generic approach. They asked a simple question: why should event coffee compromise on ethics when cafés have embraced transparency and sustainability for years? Their answer was to build a mobile coffee business that operates to the same standards as Melbourne's best sustainability-focused cafés.

The business model centers on three principles: **organic certification** (all beans are ACO-certified organic), **direct trade relationships** (they work directly with farmers or through verified ethical importers, bypassing commodity markets), and **environmental responsibility** (from compostable cups to carbon-neutral operations). These aren't marketing talking points; they're operational commitments that shape how Bean & Cart Co. sources, serves, and manages every event.

Event specialization focuses on **weddings**, **corporate sustainability events**, and **upscale private celebrations**. For weddings, Bean & Cart Co. understands that couples planning eco-conscious celebrations care deeply about vendor alignment. Their service integrates seamlessly into garden weddings, winery receptions, and heritage venue events where aesthetics and ethics both matter. Corporate clients booking sustainability conferences, ESG reporting launches, or corporate social responsibility events appreciate working with a vendor who embodies the values they're promoting.

The coverage area—Glen Iris, Ashburton, Camberwell, Malvern, and Toorak—reflects Melbourne's inner-east suburbs where sustainability consciousness and disposable income intersect. These are areas with heritage gardens (perfect for weddings), corporate offices with strong ESG programs, and homeowners hosting sophisticated private events. Bean & Cart Co. knows these suburbs intimately, from permit requirements for Glen Iris parks to preferred access routes for Malvern's heritage venues.

The cart itself is a statement piece: reclaimed timber accents, vintage-inspired design that photographs beautifully, and equipment selected for both performance and sustainability credentials. The visual aesthetic matters—this cart becomes part of your event's story, not just a functional necessity.

## Menu & Offerings

Bean & Cart Co.'s menu begins with coffee sourcing. They rotate seasonal single-origin beans from verified organic farms in Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, and Indonesia. Each origin is selected for distinct flavour profiles: Ethiopian naturals for bright, fruity notes; Colombian washed for balanced chocolate and caramel; Guatemalan for nutty complexity; Indonesian for earthy, full-bodied richness. At each event, they feature one or two origins, allowing guests to taste coffee with a clear provenance story.

The espresso menu covers café classics—flat whites, cappuccinos, lattes, long blacks, macchiatos, and piccolo lattes—each prepared with meticulous technique. Organic milk is standard (sourced from Victorian farms practicing regenerative agriculture), with organic oat milk, almond milk, and soy milk available at no extra charge. The milk program deserves emphasis: Bean & Cart Co. pays premium prices for organic dairy because milk quality affects espresso drinks as much as bean quality.

Filter coffee is offered as pour-over service for guests willing to wait 3-4 minutes for a lighter, more nuanced brew that showcases single-origin characteristics. Cold brew (served during warmer months) uses a proprietary 18-hour extraction process and is served over ice with optional house-made simple syrup from organic cane sugar.

Specialty drinks include seasonal offerings: turmeric lattes using organic turmeric and honey during autumn/winter, iced latte with vanilla bean during spring/summer, and affogatos featuring organic vanilla gelato from local suppliers. These specialty options give wedding couples ways to customize their coffee menu, perhaps creating a signature drink that reflects their taste.

Add-ons align with the sustainable ethos: organic biscotti from Melbourne bakeries, vegan protein balls, locally-made gluten-free treats, and seasonal fruit platters. Everything is individually wrapped in compostable packaging or served on rental ceramic plates (an option for weddings wanting to eliminate single-use items entirely).

Equipment quality is professional-grade: a dual-boiler espresso machine that maintains temperature precision critical for proper extraction, grinders that allow dose adjustments throughout service to account for humidity and bean freshness, and a manual pour-over station using Hario V60 equipment favored by specialty cafés.

All serviceware—cups, lids, stirrers, napkins—is commercially compostable. Bean & Cart Co. educates event organizers on proper disposal: if your venue has commercial composting, everything breaks down; if not, they can arrange collection and composting through their waste partner. For couples wanting zero waste, they offer rental ceramic cup programs where guests use proper coffee cups that are washed and returned post-event.

## Pricing & Capacity

Bean & Cart Co.'s pricing reflects their premium positioning and higher cost base (organic beans cost 30-50% more than conventional, compostable cups cost double, direct-trade relationships carry price premiums). They charge $200-280 AUD per hour with a two-hour minimum, positioning at the higher end of Melbourne's mobile coffee market.

The pricing spectrum breaks down by service complexity. A straightforward wedding reception serving standard espresso drinks at $200/hour includes organic beans, professional baristas, compostable serviceware, and basic setup. Premium packages at $280/hour might include single-origin pour-over service, custom drink menus (like that signature latte for your wedding), rental ceramic cups, carbon-neutral service (they offset any emissions through verified programs), or coordinated branding (menu boards designed to match your wedding aesthetic).

What's included in base pricing deserves transparency: organic single-origin beans, organic milk and dairy alternatives, compostable cups and serviceware, professional setup and breakdown, and a 30-minute pre-event consultation to plan your coffee menu. Unlike budget operators, there are no surcharges for oat milk, ceramic cups (if you choose that option), or extended service areas within their core coverage suburbs.

Capacity is conservatively rated at 40-120 guests per hour. The lower range reflects pour-over service (which takes longer per cup but delivers exceptional quality for coffee-focused weddings). Standard espresso service sits around 80-100 guests per hour. For weddings expecting 120 guests over a three-hour reception, a two-hour coffee service booking ensures everyone can get at least one quality coffee without long queues.

The two-hour minimum makes sense for their service model: organic coffee service requires careful preparation (beans are ground to order, milk is handled differently than conventional to preserve organic integrity), setup involves precise calibration, and Bean & Cart Co. refuses to rush service just to hit higher throughput numbers. Quality over quantity is a deliberate philosophy.

Premium pricing is justified by tangible differences: beans cost more because farmers are paid fairly, compostable materials cost more than plastic, experienced baristas command higher wages, and maintaining certifications (organic handling, food safety for specialized dietary service) carries ongoing costs. For event organizers comparing quotes, the question isn't just price—it's whether the values and quality align with your event.

## Why Choose Bean & Cart Co. for Your Event

Event suitability starts with **weddings** where Bean & Cart Co. genuinely excels. They understand wedding planning deeply, from timeline coordination to working with photographers (their cart photographs beautifully and baristas know to pause during key photo moments) to handling family dynamics (they've managed countless mother-of-the-bride coffee requests). Their aesthetic—reclaimed timber, vintage touches, beautifully presented organic coffee—integrates into wedding styling rather than clashing with your carefully planned colour palette.

Eco-conscious couples planning sustainable weddings find Bean & Cart Co. invaluable. When you're composting floral arrangements, using digital invitations to save paper, and choosing local seasonal catering, having a coffee cart that shares these values matters. Bean & Cart Co. can provide carbon-neutral service, zero-waste packaging, and transparency on every component's environmental impact—details that satisfy both your values and potentially sustainability-focused guests.

**Corporate sustainability events**—ESG report launches, net-zero commitment announcements, sustainability summits—gain credibility when vendors embody the message. Bean & Cart Co. can present their own sustainability credentials (organic certification, direct-trade relationships, carbon-neutral operations) that reinforce your event's themes. They've served corporate events where their presence was strategic: demonstrating that quality and sustainability aren't trade-offs.

**Upscale private events**—milestone anniversaries, luxury product launches, heritage venue functions—benefit from Bean & Cart Co.'s premium positioning. The organic single-origin angle adds sophistication; guests appreciate learning about Ethiopian Yirgacheffe origin stories or Colombian farm relationships while enjoying exceptional coffee. It's coffee service that sparks conversation, not just caffeine delivery.

Barista quality is central to their value proposition. Bean & Cart Co. employs specialty baristas with competition experience or advanced training, capable of discussing coffee origins, adjusting brewing parameters based on guest preferences, and creating latte art that rivals Melbourne's best cafés. These aren't just coffee makers; they're coffee educators who enhance your event through knowledge and passion.

Customer testimonials (where available) emphasize three themes: **values alignment** (couples love working with vendors who share their sustainability commitments), **quality** (guests notice the coffee difference and often ask for Bean & Cart Co.'s details post-event), and **service professionalism** (timely arrival, seamless coordination, beautiful presentation).

The unique value proposition is clear: Bean & Cart Co. brings Melbourne's specialty coffee culture and sustainability ethos to your event, proving that premium quality and environmental responsibility enhance each other rather than conflict.

## How to Book Bean & Cart Co.

Booking Bean & Cart Co. begins with an inquiry through The Bean Route's vendor directory or direct contact at hello@beanandcart.com.au (pending verification). Given their premium positioning and detailed service approach, they recommend booking 8-12 weeks ahead for weddings, 6-8 weeks for corporate events, and 4-6 weeks for private celebrations.

The booking process is consultative, not transactional. They start with a phone or video consultation to understand your event vision, discuss coffee preferences (do you prefer bright fruity coffees or rich chocolatey profiles?), and explain how their service integrates into your timeline. For weddings, they can arrange coffee tastings where you sample different single-origins to choose what you'll serve—turning coffee selection into part of your wedding planning experience.

Quotes are detailed and transparent: hourly rates, expected guest capacity, included services (organic beans, specific origins, compostable vs. ceramic cups), any travel fees for locations beyond Glen Iris core coverage, and optional add-ons (custom menu boards, extended pour-over service, carbon-neutral certification for your event). There are no surprise fees; everything is discussed and documented upfront.

Lead time matters because Bean & Cart Co. sources beans specifically for your event timeline (single-origins are seasonal, and they coordinate roasting schedules to ensure peak freshness). Wedding bookings in peak season (October-April in Melbourne) fill quickly, so early contact is strategic. Corporate events can sometimes be accommodated with shorter notice, but seasonal bean availability might limit origin choices.

Logistics are handled professionally. Bean & Cart Co. manages all permits (for park weddings or heritage venue events), coordinates with your other vendors (caterers, venue managers, wedding planners), confirms power requirements, and provides setup/breakdown timelines that integrate smoothly into your event schedule. For Glen Iris weddings at parks like Maud Street Reserve, they already know access routes, permit processes, and power solutions—experience that prevents day-of surprises.
