# Percolate: Artisan Coffee & Small Batch Roasting in Malvern

In Malvern Village's sophisticated café landscape, Percolate has carved a distinct identity as both specialty café and working roastery, where the aroma of freshly roasted beans mingles with expertly pulled espressos. Located on Glenferrie Road (specific address pending verification), Percolate appeals to coffee enthusiasts who want to understand coffee at a deeper level—from green bean sourcing to roast profiles to extraction science. But their expertise extends beyond retail café service through private venue hire, bringing roastery-direct coffee and educational experiences to intimate events, corporate tastings, and gatherings where coffee is celebration centerpiece rather than background amenity.

What distinguishes Percolate from standard cafés is their roastery component and coffee education focus. They're not just serving beans someone else roasted; they're controlling the entire process from green bean selection through roasting, resting, and brewing. For events where coffee quality and storytelling matter—product launches for food/beverage brands, corporate team building through coffee tastings, intimate celebrations for coffee-passionate hosts—Percolate offers experiences that generic caterers simply cannot replicate.

## About Percolate

Percolate was founded by specialty coffee professionals who wanted to share their roasting craft with the community, not just wholesale to other cafés. The decision to operate as both public café and private event space reflects their educational mission: demystify specialty coffee, make roasting accessible and visible, and create spaces where people can engage with coffee culture beyond just ordering flat whites.

The business model operates on three revenue streams: **walk-in café service** (daily retail coffee and food sales to Malvern locals and visitors), **coffee retail** (selling roasted beans to home brewers and corporate clients), and **private event hire** (exclusive venue bookings for coffee tastings, intimate celebrations, corporate events). This diversified model creates resilience and allows Percolate to maintain equipment and expertise that pure retail cafés couldn't justify.

Walk-in café service caters to Malvern's affluent, educated demographic—residents who've traveled internationally and know good coffee, professionals from nearby Glenferrie Road offices seeking quality environments for client meetings, and coffee enthusiasts willing to travel for exceptional beans and knowledgeable baristas. The café atmosphere is sophisticated but welcoming: exposed brick, visible roasting equipment (a working roaster is installed in-café, roasting small batches throughout the week), specialty brewing equipment, and educational displays explaining coffee processing methods and origin stories.

Private event hire transforms the café into exclusive space for groups wanting intimate, coffee-focused experiences. Typical events include: **corporate coffee tastings** (team building or client entertainment through guided cupping sessions), **product launches** for food/beverage brands seeking sophisticated venues aligned with quality positioning, **intimate celebrations** (milestone birthdays, anniversaries, engagement parties) for hosts passionate about coffee and wanting unique event experiences, and **coffee education sessions** (home barista workshops, brewing classes, origin-focused tastings).

The roastery component is central to event appeal. Percolate can offer experiences large-scale caterers cannot: fresh-roasted beans specifically prepared for your event, guided tastings comparing different roast profiles, live roasting demonstrations during events, and educational narratives about bean origins, farmer relationships, and coffee processing methods. For events where coffee is the story, not just the beverage, this expertise is irreplaceable.

Coverage for private events focuses on exclusive in-café hire (bring your group to Percolate for curated experience) rather than mobile catering. The café's 30-seat capacity limits event size but creates intimacy impossible at larger venues. For groups wanting coffee-centered experiences in sophisticated settings, this limitation becomes a feature—exclusivity and focused attention.

## Menu & Offerings

Percolate's café menu reflects their roastery expertise and commitment to showcasing coffee at its best.

**Espresso program** features their own roasted beans with rotating single-origin offerings. The current espresso might be a washed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe roasted to highlight floral jasmine notes and bright citrus acidity, while next month brings a natural-processed Colombian showcasing berry fruit and chocolate sweetness. For customers preferring consistency, a house blend is always available—a carefully balanced medium roast designed to excel in milk-based drinks.

Standard espresso menu includes: espressos, macchiatos, cortados, flat whites, cappuccinos, lattes, long blacks, and piccolos. Each is prepared with meticulous technique—proper dosing (adjusted daily based on bean rest time and ambient humidity), precise extraction timing, milk steamed to specific temperatures based on drink type, and presentation that reflects care without pretension.

**Filter coffee options** showcase single-origin beans through brewing methods that highlight their characteristics. Pour-over service using V60, Chemex, or Aeropress (method selected based on bean profile and desired outcome) takes 4-6 minutes but delivers cups that reveal coffee's full complexity. Batch filter coffee provides quality filter coffee at faster speeds for time-constrained customers. Cold brew on tap during warmer months uses extended extraction (18-24 hours) to create smooth, low-acid coffee served over ice.

**Coffee tasting flights** (available by request) allow customers to compare different origins, processing methods, or roast profiles side-by-side—educational experiences that deepen coffee appreciation. These tastings foreshadow the private event offerings where guided cuppings become structured experiences.

**Retail beans** are available for purchase, roasted on-site in small batches (typically 5-10kg batches roasted 2-3 times per week). Customers can buy beans roasted that morning, ensuring peak freshness impossible from large commercial roasters. For corporate clients, Percolate offers wholesale programs with customized roast profiles and delivery schedules.

**Food program** supports café use and private events: breakfast items (pastries, granola, eggs), lunch offerings (gourmet sandwiches, salads, seasonal specials), and all-day snacks (house-baked goods, specialty chocolates that pair with coffee). The food quality matches coffee standards—locally sourced ingredients, thoughtful preparation, and flavor profiles that complement rather than compete with coffee.

**Private event packages** bring roastery expertise to exclusive gatherings:

**Coffee Cupping Experience** ($45-65 per person, 8-20 guests, 2 hours):
- Guided professional cupping of 4-6 different coffees
- Education on cupping protocol, flavor identification, coffee scoring
- Hosted by Percolate's head roaster with deep expertise
- Light refreshments (pastries, chocolates) between tasting rounds
- Take-home bag of favorite coffee roasted on-site

**Espresso Workshop** ($65-85 per person, 6-12 guests, 2.5 hours):
- Hands-on barista training using Percolate's professional equipment
- Learn proper extraction, milk steaming, latte art basics
- Each participant makes multiple drinks with expert guidance
- Includes coffee and light food throughout
- Certificate of completion (useful for corporate team building)

**Private Café Hire with Catering** ($800-1,500 for 3-4 hours, 20-30 guests):
- Exclusive venue access (café closed to public)
- Full coffee service (espresso bar, filter options, curated bean selection)
- Food catering from breakfast to evening reception menus
- Hosted by Percolate staff or self-service depending on package
- Option to include coffee tasting or roasting demonstration
- Pricing varies by food selection and service level

Walk-in café pricing ranges $5.00-7.50 AUD per cup, positioning Percolate at premium specialty café standards. Espressos $5.00, milk-based drinks $5.80-6.50, single-origin pour-overs $7.50. The pricing reflects small-batch roasting costs, skilled barista labor, and quality ingredients—customers choosing Percolate understand they're paying for craft and expertise.

## Pricing & Capacity

Walk-in café pricing at $5.00-7.50 per cup reflects Percolate's positioning as destination roastery café rather than convenience neighborhood coffee shop. The premium pricing is justified by tangible differences: beans roasted on-site in small batches (not mass-produced), baristas trained in coffee science and extraction theory (not just drink-making), and equipment maintained to competition standards (not just functional commercial grade).

**Private event pricing** is premium and exclusive, reflecting the unique experiences Percolate offers:

**Coffee Cupping Sessions** ($45-65/person):
- Lower rate ($45) for straightforward cupping with 4 coffees, minimal additional service
- Higher rate ($65) for extensive cupping (6+ coffees), educational deep-dive, enhanced hospitality

**Espresso Workshops** ($65-85/person):
- Lower rate ($65) for standard workshop with basic latte art introduction
- Higher rate ($85) for extended workshop with competition-level techniques and personalized coaching

**Full Café Hire** ($800-1,500 base, plus per-person food costs):
- Lower base ($800) for 3-hour exclusive access with self-service coffee setup
- Higher base ($1,500) for 4-hour exclusive access with full barista service and roasting demonstration
- Food catering adds $15-40/person depending on menu (breakfast pastries vs. full reception)

These premium prices position Percolate as special-occasion venue, not everyday event space. Target clients are corporate teams with healthy budgets for unique team building, coffee-passionate individuals celebrating milestones, or brands seeking sophisticated venues that align with premium product positioning.

**Capacity limitations** create exclusivity:
- **Café seating**: 30 maximum for full venue hire events
- **Cupping sessions**: 8-20 ideal (more than 20 dilutes educational quality)
- **Espresso workshops**: 6-12 maximum (hands-on training requires manageable group sizes)
- **Standing receptions**: 40-60 possible if structured as circulation event rather than seated

The limited capacity is feature, not bug—intimate events receive attention and customization impossible at larger venues. For groups seeking exclusive, high-touch experiences, 30-person caps feel luxurious rather than restrictive.

Minimum booking requirements ensure service quality: cupping sessions require 8-person minimum (justifies roaster's time and event preparation), workshops require 6-person minimum, full café hire requires 20-person minimum or flat fee equivalent. These minimums are reasonable for the target market—corporate teams, serious coffee enthusiasts, and upscale private celebrations.

## Why Choose Percolate for Your Event

Event suitability centers on **coffee-as-experience** positioning. Percolate excels when coffee isn't background amenity but central element—product launches for food/beverage brands, corporate team building through shared learning, celebrations for hosts who are serious coffee enthusiasts, or educational events where coffee knowledge is the content.

**Corporate team building** through coffee cupping or espresso workshops creates shared experiences that feel distinctive rather than generic. Instead of trust falls or escape rooms, teams learn coffee science, develop tasting vocabulary, and bond over hands-on skill building. For companies in creative industries, food/beverage sectors, or corporate cultures valuing sophistication, coffee-centered team building aligns with brand identity.

**Product launches and brand activations** for food, beverage, or lifestyle brands benefit from Percolate's sophisticated aesthetic and coffee credibility. Launching an artisan food product, premium beverage, or design-focused consumer good? Hosting at a working roastery café signals quality positioning and creates memorable experiences that resonate with media and influencers.

**Intimate celebrations** for coffee-passionate hosts—milestone birthdays, anniversaries, engagement parties—gain uniqueness from coffee-centered programming. Imagine a 50th birthday where guests participate in cupping session followed by espresso and dessert pairings, or an engagement party where the couple who met at a café recreates that coffee-centered connection. These aren't generic "rented a venue" events; they're personalized experiences reflecting host passions.

**Coffee education and enthusiast gatherings**—home barista meetups, origin-focused tastings, processing method deep-dives—have natural home at Percolate. The working roastery, visible equipment, and expert staff create environments where coffee nerds can geek out appropriately.

The **roastery expertise advantage** is central to value. Percolate's head roaster can guide cuppings with depth that generic event venues cannot provide—discussing farmer relationships, explaining processing method impacts on flavor, demonstrating how roast profiles highlight or mute bean characteristics. This education transforms coffee from beverage to narrative.

Venue aesthetic matters for upscale events. Exposed brick, visible roasting equipment, specialty brewing stations, and sophisticated urban-industrial design photograph well and create atmosphere that elevates events beyond generic function rooms or hotel conference spaces.

Customer profile trends toward educated, affluent, experience-seeking demographics—corporate professionals investing in unique team experiences, individuals celebrating milestones with distinctive events, and brands seeking venues that enhance rather than dilute their positioning.

## How to Book Percolate

Booking Percolate for private events requires advance planning given their limited calendar availability and custom event preparation. Contact starts at hello@percolatemalvern.com.au (pending verification) or visiting the café to speak with management about private hire options.

Lead time for bookings should be 6-8 weeks minimum for coffee cupping or workshop events (allows proper planning and coffee selection), extending to 8-12 weeks for full café hire with custom programming (requires coordination with regular café operations and potential specialized roasting for your event).

The quote process is consultative and educational. Percolate's team will discuss: your event goals and desired outcomes, group demographics and coffee knowledge level (affects programming complexity), preferred event format (cupping vs. workshop vs. reception), food and beverage preferences, and budget parameters. They'll recommend appropriate formats based on experience with similar events—for example, suggesting shorter cupping for corporate teams vs. extended educational sessions for serious enthusiasts.

Pre-event coordination includes: coffee selection for your tasting (choosing origins and roast profiles that tell compelling stories), food menu planning if full catering is included, timing and flow discussion (how to structure 2-3 hours for optimal engagement), and technical requirements (AV for presentations, music preferences, photography permissions).

Event customization is Percolate's strength. They can: roast specific beans for your event date ensuring peak freshness, customize educational content to your group's knowledge level and interests, coordinate with your other vendors (photographers, florists, additional caterers), and adapt programming based on real-time group engagement.

Day-of execution reflects Percolate's expertise. Staff are experienced educators comfortable presenting to groups, equipment is prepared to demonstration standards, timing is managed professionally to keep events flowing without feeling rushed, and cleanup is handled completely.

For corporate clients with recurring team building or client entertainment needs, Percolate can establish ongoing relationships that simplify future bookings and allow progressive education—first event is coffee basics, second event dives deeper into origins or processing, third explores advanced brewing science.
