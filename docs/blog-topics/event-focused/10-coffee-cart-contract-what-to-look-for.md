### Red Flags to Watch For (400 words)

**🚩 No Written Contract**
- Professional vendors always provide contracts
- Email confirmation acceptable minimum (for small events)

**🚩 Vague Deliverables**
- "Approximately 2 hours" → should be exact
- "Coffee service" → should specify menu items
- "1-2 baristas" → should commit to number

**🚩 No Cancellation Policy**
- You need to know refund terms upfront
- Fair policy: Sliding scale based on notice

**🚩 100% Upfront Payment Required**
- Standard: 25-50% deposit, balance before event
- 100% upfront = risk (vendor could no-show)

**🚩 No Insurance Mention**
- All vendors should carry public liability insurance
- Request certificate of currency

**🚩 Hidden Fees**
- Travel fees not disclosed upfront
- "Service charge" added later
- Weekend surcharge not mentioned

**🚩 No Weather Policy (Outdoor Events)**
- Outdoor events need contingency clause
- Fair: Reschedule or refund if weather cancels

**🚩 Extreme Cancellation Terms**
- "No refunds ever" = unreasonable
- Fair policy balances both parties
