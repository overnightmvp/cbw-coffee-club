## Outline

### Introduction (150 words)
- Event emergency: Caterer canceled, original plan fell through
- Vendor flexibility varies (some accept last-minute, others don't)
- This guide covers what's possible and how to maximize chances

### What Counts as "Last-Minute"? (250 words)

**Industry Definitions**
- **Very last-minute**: <48 hours (day-of or day-before)
- **Last-minute**: 3-7 days notice
- **Short notice**: 7-14 days
- **Standard**: 2-4 weeks

**Vendor Availability**
- Peak season (Nov-April): 2-4 weeks booked out (weddings, corporate events)
- Off-season (May-Oct): 1-2 weeks availability
- Weekdays: More last-minute availability than weekends
- Sundays: Sometimes available (less popular than Saturdays)

**Event Type Matters**
- Small events (<50 guests): Easier to book last-minute (1 barista)
- Large events (150+ guests): Harder (requires multiple baristas, equipment)
- Flexible timing: Easier (vendor can adjust schedule)
- Fixed timing: Harder (may conflict with existing bookings)

### Can You Book Same-Day Coffee Cart Service? (400 words)

**Short Answer: Sometimes, but rare**

**When Same-Day Might Work:**
- **Weekday mornings** (Mon-Thu, before 10am)
- **Small events** (<30 people)
- **Flexible timing** (vendor chooses arrival time)
- **Off-peak season** (winter months)
- **Vendor has cancellation** (sudden availability)

**When Same-Day Won't Work:**
- **Weekends** (pre-booked months ahead)
- **Large events** (>80 people, requires prep)
- **Peak season** (Nov-April)
- **Fixed timing** (needs to be 2pm exactly)
- **Complex setup** (outdoor, generator, marquee)

**What to Expect Same-Day:**
- **Limited vendor options** (1-2 available vs 10+ normally)
- **Higher prices** (+20-50% surcharge for urgency)
- **Less flexibility** (vendor dictates timing, menu)
- **No customization** (standard service only)

**Case Study: Emergency Corporate Event**
- **Situation**: Corporate breakfast caterer canceled at 8pm night before
- **Need**: Coffee for 60 people, 8:30am next morning
- **Solution**: Found vendor who had cancellation, agreed to 9am arrival (late start acceptable to client)
- **Cost**: $750 (vs $550 standard, +35% surcharge)
- **Result**: Successful, but stressful

### 3-7 Day Last-Minute Bookings (More Realistic) (450 words)

**Availability Outlook**
- **Weekdays**: 60-70% of vendors have availability
- **Sundays**: 40-50% availability
- **Saturdays**: 20-30% availability (peak wedding day)
- **Peak season**: Reduce above by 20-30%

**What's Possible**
- Standard coffee cart service (1-2 baristas)
- Indoor or outdoor setup (if weather favorable)
- Full menu options
- Most Melbourne suburbs

**What's Harder**
- Multiple carts (requires multiple available teams)
- Customization (branded cups, special signage)
- Specific vendor (your first choice may be booked)
- Large events (>150 guests, requires coordination)

**How to Maximize Chances**
- **Be flexible on timing** (vendor suggests best time slot)
- **Widen suburbs** (consider vendors outside immediate area)
- **Consider alternatives** (barista station vs cart if cart unavailable)
- **Offer premium** (willing to pay slightly more for urgency)

**Pricing for 3-7 Day Bookings**
- Standard rate applies (no surcharge typically)
- Some vendors may add +10-15% for short notice (rare)
- Payment terms: 50% deposit immediately, balance day-before

**Case Study: Wedding Planner Emergency**
- **Situation**: Bride's original coffee cart vendor canceled 5 days before Saturday wedding
- **Need**: Wedding-quality cart, 120 guests, 1-hour cocktail hour
- **Solution**: Called 8 vendors, found one with Sunday available (moved wedding reception start time 2 hours later to accommodate Sunday)
- **Cost**: $850 (standard rate for 2 baristas, Sunday)
- **Result**: Success, but required timeline adjustment

**Realistic Expectations**
- You'll find *a* vendor (probably)
- You may not find your *ideal* vendor
- May require some flexibility (timing, location within venue, menu)

### The Last-Minute Booking Process (500 words)

**Step 1: Contact Multiple Vendors Immediately (Within 1 Hour)**
- Call 10-15 vendors simultaneously
- Use TBR inquiry form (notifies all relevant vendors)
- Be transparent about timing
- Example message:
  > "I have an urgent request for coffee cart service on [date] for [X] guests. Timing flexible between [X-Y hours]. Budget $XXX. Please respond ASAP if available."

**Step 2: Respond Fast to Available Vendors (Within 30 Minutes)**
- Last-minute = first-come-first-served
- If you wait 2 hours, vendor may book another client
- Have payment ready (deposit immediately)

**Step 3: Confirm Critical Details**
- Event date, time, location
- Guest count estimate
- Setup requirements (power, space)
- Pricing and payment terms
- Cancellation policy (important for last-minute)

**Step 4: Pay Deposit Immediately**
- Last-minute bookings require faster payment
- 50% deposit typical (vs 25% for standard bookings)
- Credit card instant payment (vs bank transfer delay)

**Step 5: Communicate with Venue**
- Confirm vendor access (no surprise restrictions)
- Verify power and space availability
- Vendor contact info to venue coordinator

**Step 6: Final Headcount & Timing Confirmation (Day Before)**
- Confirm exact timing and final guest count
- Pay balance (often required day-before for last-minute)
- Exchange contact numbers for day-of

**What Vendors Need to Know Last-Minute:**
- Exact date and time
- Guest count (even rough estimate)
- Venue address and type (home, office, outdoor, etc.)
- Power availability (if known)
- Your contact number (for quick communication)

**Red Flags for Last-Minute Bookings:**
- Vendor hesitant or vague (may flake)
- No contract or written confirmation (risky)
- 100% payment upfront required (scam risk)
- Price seems too good to be true (unprofessional)

### Surcharges & Premiums for Last-Minute (300 words)

**Typical Surcharges**
- **Same-day**: +30-50% (if vendor even accepts)
- **2-3 days notice**: +10-20% (some vendors)
- **4-7 days notice**: Standard rate (most vendors)

**Why Surcharges Exist**
- Vendor disrupts schedule (opportunity cost)
- Rushed preparation (less ideal for vendor)
- Risk of no-show (less time to vet client)
- Peak season: vendor gives up better-paying future booking

**Negotiate or Accept?**
- If truly urgent: Accept surcharge (your leverage is low)
- If somewhat flexible: Negotiate (offer weekday instead of weekend, vendor may waive surcharge)
- If multiple vendors available: Choose standard rate vendor

**When No Surcharge**
- Vendor had cancellation (sudden availability)
- Off-peak season (vendor grateful for booking)
- Weekday event (less competitive day)
- Small event (easy for vendor to accommodate)

### Alternatives if No Coffee Cart Available (350 words)

**Alternative 1: Barista Station (vs Cart)**
- More vendors offer stations than carts (wider availability)
- Less equipment needed (faster to mobilize)
- Similar quality, less aesthetic appeal

**Alternative 2: Coffee Truck (vs Cart)**
- Larger vendors may have trucks available when carts booked
- Higher capacity (good for large last-minute events)
- Often +$200-300 premium

**Alternative 3: Batch Brew Service**
- Not espresso, but quality batch coffee
- Faster to setup (no espresso machine warm-up)
- Lower cost ($300-400 vs $550-700)
- Best for: Morning events where speed > quality

**Alternative 4: DIY Coffee Station**
- Last resort if no vendors available
- Rent espresso machine ($200-300/day)
- Hire freelance barista ($200-300/day)
- Total: $400-600, but requires coordination
- Risk: Equipment failure, no backup

**Alternative 5: Venue Catering**
- If venue offers coffee service (often poor quality)
- Better than nothing for last-minute emergency

**Alternative 6: Postpone Coffee Component**
- If event can proceed without coffee
- Focus on other beverages (tea, juice, etc.)
- Add coffee at future event

- Corporate events: Book 4-6 weeks ahead
