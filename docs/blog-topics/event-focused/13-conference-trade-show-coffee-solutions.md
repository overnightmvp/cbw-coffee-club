- **Pros**: Maximum convenience, constant networking hub

- Corporate training: All-day continuous (maximize learning environment)

### Capacity Planning for Conferences (450 words)

**Attendee Coffee Consumption**
- Morning arrival (8-9am): 50-60% order
- Morning break (10am): 60-70% order
- Lunch break (12:30pm): 40-50% order
- Afternoon break (3pm): 50-60% order
- **Total daily consumption**: 1.5-2 cups per attendee across all breaks

**Break Time Constraints**
- 15-minute breaks = extremely tight
- 20-minute breaks = manageable
- 30-minute breaks = comfortable

**Barista Capacity Math**
- 1 barista: 80 cups/hour (ideal) = 20 cups/15-min break
- 200-person conference, 70% uptake = 140 cups needed per break
- **Result**: Need 7 baristas OR stagger breaks OR extend break time

**Realistic Solutions**
- **Option 1**: Multiple carts (3-4 carts with 1 barista each = 240 cups/hour)
- **Option 2**: Dual-barista stations (2 carts, 2 baristas each = 320 cups/hour)
- **Option 3**: Pre-break coffee (open 10 min early, extend 5 min late = 30 min window)
- **Option 4**: Batch brew + espresso combo (batch for simple drinks, espresso for specialty)

**Multi-Day Conferences**
- Day 1: Highest demand (curiosity, excitement)
- Day 2-3: Demand plateaus (some attendees bring own coffee)
- Plan for Day 1 capacity, slightly scale back Day 2-3 if needed

### Conference Venue Logistics (500 words)

**Venue Coordination**
- **Loading dock access**: Early morning load-in (before attendees arrive)
- **Freight elevator**: If conference on upper floors
- **Setup locations**: Near session rooms, not blocking fire exits
- **Power access**: Industrial power usually available (15-amp or 20-amp)
- **Water access**: Large conferences may need plumbed water (90L tanks insufficient)

**Space Planning**
- **Foyer/atrium**: Ideal (central location, open space)
- **Exhibition hall**: If trade show component (integrate with booths)
- **Breakout areas**: Multiple carts for multi-track conferences
- **Outdoor areas**: Terrace or courtyard (weather-dependent)

**Common Conference Venues in Melbourne**
- **Melbourne Convention Centre**: Large-scale, industrial power, multiple cart locations
- **Crown Conference Centre**: Premium setup, excellent facilities
- **MCEC (Jeff's Shed)**: Massive space, requires multiple carts
- **Hotel conference centers** (Sofitel, Grand Hyatt, etc.): Smaller rooms, single cart sufficient
- **University venues** (Monash, Melbourne Uni): Academic conferences, budget-conscious

**Venue Restrictions to Clarify**
- Exclusive catering clauses (some venues prohibit external food/beverage)
- Insurance requirements (often $20M public liability for large venues)
- Union labor rules (some venues require venue staff to operate equipment)
- Setup/breakdown timing (overnight vs day-of)
