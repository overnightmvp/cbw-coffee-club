## Outline

### Introduction (150 words)
- Venue type dramatically affects coffee cart setup
- Indoor and outdoor have different requirements, costs, and challenges
- This guide helps you plan appropriately

### Indoor Coffee Cart Setup (600 words)

**Advantages**
- Weather protection (rain, wind, heat)
- Controlled environment (consistent coffee quality)
- Existing power infrastructure
- Stable surface (no ground concerns)
- No generator needed (usually)
- Easier access (loading docks, elevators)

**Challenges**
- Space constraints (doorways, hallways)
- Ventilation (steam management)
- Noise considerations (acoustic spaces)
- Venue restrictions (floor protection, wall clearance)
- Power outlet locations (extension cord management)

**Setup Requirements**
- Minimum doorway width: 90cm
- Ceiling height: 2.5m+ (steam clearance)
- Power: 2x 10-amp outlets within 10m
- Floor: Level surface, no uneven transitions
- Space: 2m x 2m minimum (plus queue area)

**Venue-Specific Considerations**
- **Function centers**: Usually ideal (purpose-built)
- **Corporate offices**: Elevators, access timing, carpet protection
- **Hotels/venues**: Coordinate with venue staff, existing catering rules
- **Museums/galleries**: Strict floor protection, noise limits
- **Warehouses**: Check power availability, HVAC

**Cost Implications**
- Standard pricing applies
- May save on generator cost
- Setup/pack-down usually faster

### Outdoor Coffee Cart Setup (700 words)

**Advantages**
- Open space (no doorway constraints)
- Visual appeal (natural backdrop)
- Alfresco vibe (suits garden events, festivals)
- More setup flexibility
- No venue restrictions (usually)

**Challenges**
- **Weather**: Rain, wind, extreme heat/cold
- **Power**: May need generator ($100-200 extra)
- **Ground surface**: Uneven grass, gravel, sand
- **Shade**: Direct sun affects machine temperature
- **Permits**: May need council approval (public spaces)
- **Logistics**: No loading dock, longer setup time

**Setup Requirements**
- Power: Generator or extension from building (max 50m)
- Ground: Level surface or plywood base
- Weather protection: Marquee/gazebo strongly recommended ($200-400)
- Space: 3m x 3m recommended (includes marquee)
- Parking: Vehicle access within 50m for load-in

**Weather Contingency Planning**

**Rain**
- **Must-have**: Marquee or covered area
- Cart can operate in rain (if covered)
- Backup: Move indoors if available

**Wind**
- Wind above 30km/h: Safety concern
- Secure cart with stakes/weights
- Consider postponing if high wind forecast

**Heat (Summer)**
- Direct sun: Affects milk temperature, machine performance
- Shade essential (marquee or tree cover)
- Barista comfort (fans, breaks)

**Cold (Winter)**
- Machine takes longer to heat
- Additional warm-up time needed
- Hot drinks more popular (simpler service, faster)

**Location-Specific Outdoor Setups**
- **Garden weddings**: Scenic but power challenging (generator)
- **Festivals/markets**: Long days, need generator + refill access
- **Beach events**: Sand difficult (plywood required), wind exposure
- **Park events**: Public permits, power from amenities building
- **Rooftop events**: Wind exposure, elevator access for load-in

**Cost Implications**
- Generator: +$100-200
- Marquee: +$200-400 (if vendor provides, or DIY)
- Plywood base: +$50 (uneven ground)
- Longer setup: May affect pricing
- Parking/access fees: Venue-dependent

### Head-to-Head Comparison (500 words)

| **Setup time** | 30-40 min | 45-60 min (ground prep, marquee) |
| **Cost** | Standard ($450-600) | +$100-400 (generator, marquee) |

### Hybrid Setup: Indoor Event with Outdoor Cart (250 words)

**Best of Both Worlds**
- Event inside, cart on patio/terrace
- Requires: Outdoor cart setup + indoor venue
- Pros: Unique experience, spill-over space
- Cons: Split guest attention, weather risk
- Best for: Large venues with indoor/outdoor flow

**Example: Wedding Reception**
- Ceremony/dinner indoors (climate controlled)
- Coffee cart on terrace (cocktail hour or late-night)
- Provides smoking area hub, photo opportunity

### Decision Framework (400 words)

**Choose Indoor If:**
- Melbourne winter/unpredictable weather
- Venue has excellent indoor space
- Budget is tight (avoid generator/marquee costs)
- Client-facing corporate event (reliability over aesthetics)
- Tight timeline (faster setup)

**Choose Outdoor If:**
- Summer event (Nov-March) with good weather forecast
- Garden/park venue with limited indoor options
- Aesthetic is priority (garden wedding, festival vibe)
- Budget allows weather contingencies
- Outdoor event requires outdoor cart (obvious)

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
1. What's the weather forecast? (3-7 days before, check again)
2. Is there backup indoor space?
3. Does venue have outdoor power access?
4. Is aesthetic or reliability more important?
5. What's the budget for weather contingencies?
