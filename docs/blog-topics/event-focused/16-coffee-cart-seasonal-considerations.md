### Summer Coffee Cart Events (Dec-Feb) (700 words)

**Summer Event Season**
- Peak wedding season (Dec-Jan especially)
- Corporate Christmas parties (Nov-Dec)
- Outdoor festivals and markets
- Garden parties and BBQs
- Higher booking demand = book 6-8 weeks ahead

**Weather Challenges**

*Heat (30-40°C Days)*
- Direct sun affects espresso machine temperature
- Milk temperature control challenging
- Barista comfort (need shade, breaks, water)
- Cart components expand (machine calibration shifts)

*Sun Exposure*
- Marquee essential (not just for rain)
- Shade tree alternative
- Reflective surfaces (cart gets hot)
- Guest comfort (queue in sun)

*Wind (Summer Storms)*
- Afternoon storms common in Melbourne summer
- Secure marquee with stakes/weights
- Backup indoor location needed
- Weather forecast check day-before essential

**Menu Adjustments for Summer**

*Cold Drink Demand Surges*
- 50-60% of orders may be iced drinks
- Iced lattes, iced long blacks, cold brew
- Frappe and blended options (if vendor offers)
- Pre-batch cold brew for speed

*Hot Drinks Still Popular*
- Morning events: Hot drinks still 70% of orders
- Evening events: 50/50 hot and cold
- Never assume "too hot for hot coffee" (mistake)

*Equipment Needs*
- Ice machine or large ice supply
- Cold brew kegs (pre-made for volume)
- Iced drink shakers
- Extra cold milk storage

**Pricing Considerations**
- Peak season premium (+10-20%)
- Saturday bookings months in advance
- Weekday availability better (less competitive)
- Generator costs (outdoor events)

**Guest Behavior**
- Outdoor events preferred (weather allows)
- Shorter queue patience (heat = irritable)
- Higher consumption (iced drinks = refreshment)
- Casual dress (thongs, shorts = relaxed vibe)

**Summer Event Tips**
- Book early (6-8 weeks minimum for Dec-Jan)
- Have backup indoor location (sudden storms)
- Provide shade for cart and queue
- Hydration for barista (include in rider requirements)
- Schedule morning or evening (avoid 1-4pm peak heat)

**Ideal Summer Event Times**
- Morning: 8am-11am (before heat)
- Evening: 5pm-8pm (cooling down)
- Avoid: 12pm-3pm (peak heat, worst for outdoor coffee)

**Case Study: Outdoor Wedding in January**
- Date: Saturday, mid-January (38°C forecast)
- Setup: Garden wedding, 2pm ceremony
- Challenge: Cocktail hour 3pm-4pm (peak heat)
- Solution: Marquee with fans, 70% iced drink orders
- Result: Successful but required significant shade setup
- Learning: Should have scheduled evening wedding to avoid heat

### Winter Coffee Cart Events (Jun-Aug) (650 words)

**Winter Event Season**
- Fewer weddings (cold weather deters outdoor)
- Corporate events continue (indoor venues)
- Lower booking demand = easier availability
- Indoor events preferred

**Weather Challenges**

*Cold (5-15°C Days)*
- Machines take longer to warm up (+15 min setup time)
- Steam production slower (cold air)
- Outdoor events less appealing (guests reluctant to queue in cold)
- Barista comfort (need warm clothing, breaks)

*Rain (Melbourne's Wettest Season)*
- Frequent rain (marquee essential)
- Wet ground (plywood base for stability)
- Guest willingness to queue in rain (lower)
- Setup challenges (equipment protection)

*Wind (Cold Fronts)*
- Strong winds common (July-Aug)
- Marquee stability critical
- Heat dissipation (coffee cools faster)

**Menu Adjustments for Winter**

*Hot Drink Dominance*
- 95% of orders will be hot drinks
- Lattes, cappuccinos, flat whites
- Hot chocolate demand increases (+20%)
- Chai lattes popular (warming spices)

*Comfort Drinks*
- Rich, warming flavors (caramel, hazelnut, vanilla)
- Larger sizes (warmth lasts longer)
- Extra hot requests common (specify milk temp)

*Cold Drinks?*
- Some still order iced (10-15%)
- Don't eliminate entirely
- Iced long black (surprisingly popular year-round)

**Pricing Considerations**
- Off-season discounts possible (10-15% less than summer)
- Weekday availability excellent
- Saturdays still book 2-4 weeks ahead (less competition)
- Generator costs same (if outdoor)

**Guest Behavior**
- Indoor events strongly preferred
- Outdoor events: Shorter service windows (guests don't linger)
- Queue patience higher (warming up with coffee = motivation)
- Formal dress (suits, coats = professional events)

**Winter Event Tips**
- Book 2-4 weeks ahead (easier than summer)
- Indoor setup preferred (weather unpredictable)
- If outdoor: Marquee + heaters essential
- Allow extra warm-up time (machine calibration)
- Hot chocolate and chai options essential
- Avoid outdoor evening events (too cold)

**Ideal Winter Event Times**
- Morning: 8am-11am (warming up for day)
- Midday: 11am-2pm (warmest part of day if outdoor)
- Avoid: Evening outdoor (guests won't brave cold)

**Case Study: Corporate Winter Event**
- Date: Thursday, mid-July (12°C, drizzle forecast)
- Setup: Office building lobby (indoor, thank goodness)
- Service: 8am-10am morning coffee for staff (120 people)
