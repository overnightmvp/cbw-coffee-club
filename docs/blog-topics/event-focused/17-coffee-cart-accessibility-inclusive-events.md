### Dietary Inclusivity (800 words)

**Dairy-Free & Lactose-Free Options**

*Standard Alternatives (Should Be Included)*
- Oat milk (most popular alternative, froths well)
- Almond milk (nut allergy concern, but common)
- Soy milk (traditional alternative, good for lattes)
- Lactose-free dairy milk (for those who prefer dairy taste)

*Cost Considerations*
- Most vendors include 2-3 alternatives in base price
- Oat milk premium (+$0.50/cup) sometimes charged
- Ask vendors: "Are alternative milks included or extra cost?"

*Quality Matters*
- Not all alternative milks froth equally
- Barista-grade alternatives essential (Oatly Barista, Minor Figures)
- Poor-quality alternatives = split milk, poor texture

**Case Study: Vegan Wedding**
- 180 guests, 80% requested oat or almond milk
- Vendor prepared 15L oat milk, 10L almond milk (vs 8L dairy)
- Result: Perfect, no guests missed out
- Learning: Communicate dietary preferences to vendor ahead

**Gluten-Free Considerations**
- Coffee itself gluten-free
- Risk: Cross-contamination from pastries/snacks
- If serving food: Separate tongs, clearly labeled

**Allergies & Sensitivities**

*Common Coffee-Related Allergies*
- Nut allergies (almond milk = concern)
- Dairy allergies (cross-contamination from shared steamer)
- Soy allergies (soy milk)

*How Vendors Can Accommodate*
- Separate milk jugs for each type (prevent cross-contamination)
- Rinse steam wand between milk types
- Communicate allergen info clearly (menu board)

**Sugar-Free Options**
- Decaf coffee (caffeine sensitivity)
- Sugar-free syrups (diabetes, low-carb diets)
- Unsweetened alternatives
- Communicate: Guests can order "no sugar" (sometimes assumed)

**Religious & Cultural Dietary Needs**

*Halal Considerations*
- Coffee and milk: Halal by default
- Concern: Gelatin-based marshmallows (if serving with hot chocolate)
- Alcohol-infused drinks (Irish coffee, coffee cocktails)

*Kosher Considerations*
- Coffee: Kosher (no concerns)
- Milk: Check kosher certification if strict observance
- Rare concern for most events

*Vegan Events*
- All plant-based milk alternatives
- Ensure no honey (if serving sweeteners)
- Check cup liners (most compostable cups are vegan)

**Kids & Non-Coffee Drinkers**
- Babycino (steamed milk with chocolate)
- Hot chocolate (Milo, cocoa)
- Decaf options (kids who want "coffee like parents")
- Tea, chai (alternative hot drinks)

**Pregnancy-Friendly Options**
- Decaf espresso drinks (pregnancy caffeine limits)
- Communicate: Pregnant guests often ask "is decaf available?"
- Swiss Water Process decaf (chemical-free, safer)

**Menu Board Clarity**
- Label all dietary options clearly
- "Oat, almond, soy, lactose-free available"
- "All drinks available decaf"
- "Sugar-free syrups: vanilla, caramel"
- "Ask about allergen info"

### Physical Accessibility (600 words)

**Wheelchair Accessibility**

*Cart Height Considerations*
- Standard cart: Serving window 90-110cm high
- Wheelchair user reach: ~120cm max
- Problem: Some carts too tall for wheelchair users to see menu or interact

*Solutions*
- Lower service window (some carts adjustable)
- Barista comes around cart to take order (best solution)
- Digital menu board at eye level (wheelchair height)

*Queue Space*
- Wide aisles (120cm minimum for wheelchair turning)
- Avoid narrow gaps, crowded queue areas
- Flat surface (no steps, curbs, uneven ground)

**Walker & Mobility Aid Access**
- No steps to cart area
- Firm ground (grass difficult for walkers, wheelchairs)
- Seating nearby (elderly guests may need to sit after ordering)

**Service Dog Accommodation**
- Service dogs welcome near cart (no food safety issue)
- Some guests may have assistance animals
- Baristas should be comfortable with service dogs present

**Vision Impairment Considerations**

*Menu Accessibility*
- Large print menu (18pt font minimum)
- High contrast (black text on white background)
- Audio menu (barista reads menu aloud if requested)
- Braille menu (rare, but high-end events may provide)

*Queue Navigation*
- Clear floor markings (tape, cones) for queue
- Tactile guidance (especially crowded events)
- Barista verbally guides guest through order process

**Hearing Impairment Considerations**

*Communication Methods*
- Barista writing pad (for complex orders)
- Menu pointing system (guest points to drink, barista confirms)
- Clear speech, face-to-face (lip reading)
- Basic sign language training for baristas (ideal, rare)

*Order Notification*
- Visual cue system (flash light when order ready)
- Name written on cup (guest watches for name)
- Avoid shouting names (hearing impaired guests miss this)

**Elderly Guest Considerations**
- Lower cart height (easier to see, order)
- Patience (may take longer to decide, communicate)
- Seating nearby (cannot stand long in queue)
- Clear, loud speech (age-related hearing loss)

**Sensory Sensitivities (Neurodivergent Guests)**

*Noise Management*
- Espresso machines = loud (steam wand, grinder)
- Some neurodivergent guests sensitive to noise
- Solutions: Quiet hours (if possible), warn guests of noise levels

*Visual Overstimulation*
- Busy cart setup, multiple people, visual clutter
- Solutions: Clear signage, organized queue, calm barista demeanor

*Social Interaction Preferences*
- Some guests prefer minimal interaction ("one latte please")
- Avoid forced conversation (read guest cues)
- Respect personal space

- Total impact: $20-50 for 100-person event (negligible)

**When to Negotiate**
- If vendor charges significant premium for alternative milks (+$1/cup), negotiate
- Most Melbourne vendors now include alternatives (competitive pressure)
