## Outline

### Introduction (150 words)
- Common question: "Will one cart be enough?"
- Under-catering = long queues + unhappy guests
- Over-catering = wasted budget
- This guide provides clear calculation + interactive tool

### The Golden Ratio: 80 Cups Per Hour Per Barista (300 words)
- Industry standard capacity
- Assumes: Standard espresso drinks (lattes, cappuccinos)
- Variables that affect speed:
  - Drink complexity (single shot vs double)
  - Barista experience
  - Queue management
  - Equipment quality
- Conservative estimate: 60-70 cups/hour (if you want buffer)
- Optimistic: 90-100 cups/hour (experienced barista, simple drinks)

### Guest Consumption Patterns (400 words)

**Average Consumption Rates**
- Corporate morning events: 70-80% of guests order
- Weddings (cocktail hour): 40-50% of guests order
- All-day conferences: 60-70% order (per break)
- Evening events: 30-40% order (after dinner)

**Peak vs Sustained Service**
- First 30 minutes: Heavy rush (everyone orders)
- Next 30 minutes: Trickle orders
- Longer events: Spread out demand

**Event Type Consumption Multipliers**
- Corporate breakfast: 0.75 cups per guest
- Wedding cocktail hour: 0.5 cups per guest
- Conference break (1 hour): 0.65 cups per guest
- Festival (all day): 0.3 cups per guest (spread over time)

### Quick Calculation Formula (300 words)

**Step 1: Estimate Total Cups Needed**
```
Total cups = Guest count × Consumption rate
```

**Step 2: Calculate Service Time Available**
```
Service hours = Event duration (or designated coffee service window)
```

**Step 3: Calculate Baristas Needed**
```
Baristas needed = Total cups ÷ (80 cups/hour × Service hours)
```

**Step 4: Round Up**
- Always round up to nearest whole barista
- Add +1 barista if result is close to whole number (e.g., 1.8 → 3 baristas)

**Examples**

*Example 1: Corporate Morning Event*
- 150 guests
- 2-hour coffee service
- Consumption rate: 75% (112 cups)
- Calculation: 112 ÷ (80 × 2) = 0.7 baristas
- **Result: 1 barista sufficient**

*Example 2: Wedding Cocktail Hour*
- 200 guests
- 1-hour service window
- Consumption rate: 50% (100 cups)
- Calculation: 100 ÷ (80 × 1) = 1.25 baristas
- **Result: 2 baristas (or 1 cart with 2 baristas)**

*Example 3: Large Corporate Event*
- 500 guests
- 3-hour service window
- Consumption rate: 70% (350 cups)
- Calculation: 350 ÷ (80 × 3) = 1.46 baristas
- **Result: 2 baristas (one cart with dual baristas, or 2 carts)**

- Estimated cost range (based on pricing data)

**Output Example:**
"For your 250-guest wedding with 1-hour service, we recommend:
- **2 baristas** (approximately 125 cups)
- Setup: 1 cart with 2 baristas
- Estimated cost: $800-1200
- [View vendors who can accommodate this capacity]"

### One Cart vs Multiple Carts (400 words)

**One Cart, Multiple Baristas**
- Capacity: Up to 2 baristas per cart (standard)
- Pros: Lower cost, smaller footprint
- Cons: Single queue (potential bottleneck)
- Best for: <200 guests

**Multiple Carts**
- Capacity: Unlimited (scale with carts)
- Pros: Spread out queues, redundancy, variety
- Cons: Higher cost, more space needed
- Best for: 300+ guests, large venues

**Variety Setup** (emerging trend)
- Multiple carts with different offerings
- Cart 1: Hot espresso drinks
- Cart 2: Cold brew + iced drinks
- Cart 3: Specialty/seasonal drinks
- Benefits: Shorter queues, guest choice

### Factors That Increase Capacity Needs (300 words)

**Increase Barista Count If:**
- Event has tight timeline (e.g., 30-min conference break)
- Limited window (cocktail hour vs all-day access)
- Complex drink menu (specialty drinks take longer)
- Inexperienced barista
- First-time vendor (unknown speed)
- VIP guests (don't want them waiting)

**You Can Scale Back If:**
- Longer service window (3+ hours)
- Simple drink menu (batch brew vs espresso)
- Experienced vendor with track record
- Demographic unlikely to all order (e.g., evening event)

### Queue Management Strategies (300 words)

**Avoid Long Lines**
- Pre-order option (apps, rare but growing)
- Stagger service (announce "coffee service open" in phases)
- Dual stations on one cart (if space allows)
- Communicate wait time expectations

**Guest Experience**
- 5-minute wait: Acceptable
- 10-minute wait: Borderline
- 15+ minute wait: Poor experience (under-staffed)

### Real Event Case Studies (400 words)

**Case Study 1: Under-Staffed Disaster**
- Event: 300-guest wedding, 1-hour cocktail hour
- Setup: 1 cart, 1 barista
- Result: 40-minute queues, many guests didn't get coffee, complaints
- Lesson: Should have had 2 baristas minimum

**Case Study 2: Perfect Capacity**
- Event: 200-guest corporate breakfast, 2 hours
- Setup: 1 cart, 2 baristas
- Result: 5-10 min waits, 140 cups served (70% uptake)
- Lesson: Accurate calculation paid off

**Case Study 3: Over-Staffed (Wasteful)**
- Event: 100-guest private party, 3 hours
- Setup: 2 carts, 2 baristas each
- Result: Baristas idle most of time, only 60 cups served
- Lesson: 1 cart with 1 barista would have sufficed
