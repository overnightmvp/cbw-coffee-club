### Melbourne Coffee Expectations (600 words)

**Quality Standards**

*Espresso Extraction*
- Crema: Expected (thick, honey-colored)
- Taste: Balanced (not sour, not overly bitter)
- Temperature: Goldilocks zone (not lukewarm, not scalding)
- Consumers: Can tell good from bad (palate developed)

*Milk Texturing*
- Microfoam: Velvety, no large bubbles (silky mouthfeel)
- Temperature: 60-65°C ideal (too hot = burnt milk, complaint)
- Latte art: Expected baseline (at least heart or simple tulip)
- Alternative milks: Must froth properly (barista-grade essential)

*Bean Quality*
- Freshly roasted: 2-6 weeks post-roast ideal
- Origin transparency: Consumers ask "Where are these beans from?"
- Roast level: Medium preferred (not over-roasted, burnt)
- Single-origin appreciation: Growing demand for traceable beans

**Service Expectations**

*Speed vs Quality Balance*
- Wait time: 5-7 min acceptable (if quality delivered)
- Rush: Cutting corners noticed, punished (reviews, no repeat)
- Balance: Efficient workflow without sacrificing taste

*Barista Knowledge*
- Coffee literacy: Know your beans (origin, roaster, tasting notes)
- Equipment: Understand your machine (can explain to curious guests)
- Recommendations: Suggest drinks based on guest preferences
- Education: Explain differences (flat white vs latte, not annoyed by questions)

*Presentation*
- Clean setup: Organized cart, tidy workspace
- Professional appearance: Clean apron, groomed, friendly
- Cup quality: Not cheap disposable (if bad cups, better beans mean nothing)
- Attention to detail: Stirrer, napkin, lid properly fitted

**The Melbourne Coffee Snob (Affectionate)**

*Who They Are*
- Work in coffee: Baristas, roasters, café owners (20% of guests)
- Enthusiasts: Home espresso setup, follow roasters on Instagram
- Travelers: Experienced international coffee cultures

*What They Notice*
- Extraction time (counting seconds)
- Crema quality (dissipating foam = stale beans)

- Ambassadors: If impressed, they'll rave to friends

### The Flat White: Melbourne's Icon (400 words)

**What is a Flat White?**
- Origin: Debated (Melbourne or Sydney, 1980s)
- Definition: Double ristretto + micro-foam milk
- Size: 5-6oz (180mL) traditionally, 8oz (240mL) modern
- Texture: Velvety microfoam, not thick foam like cappuccino

**Flat White vs Latte**
- Coffee ratio: Flat white stronger (double ristretto vs single/double shot)
- Milk: Flat white less milk, thinner foam layer
- Size: Flat white smaller (6-8oz vs 12oz latte)
- Texture: Flat white silkier (microfoam vs foam layer)

**Melbourne Flat White Standards**
- Temperature: 60-63°C (hotter = incorrect)
- Foam: Integrated microfoam (not thick layer)
- Cup: Ceramic ideal (disposable acceptable for mobile)
- Milk-to-coffee ratio: Balanced (milk enhances, doesn't dominate)

**How Mobile Vendors Should Serve It**
- Perfect micro-foam (practice essential)
- Correct temperature (thermometer initially, then muscle memory)
- Don't over-fill (respect traditional size, even if disposable cup)
- Explain if asked (many interstate/international guests unfamiliar)

**Common Mistakes**
- Too much milk (becomes weak latte)
- Foam too thick (cappuccino territory)
- Temperature too high (burnt milk)
- Wrong ratio (espresso overpowered or lost)

**Why It Matters**
- Cultural icon: Ordering flat white = Melbourne credential
- Quality test: How vendor makes flat white = skill indicator
- Brand: Get flat white right = everything else probably good

- Direct trade: Farm stories, transparency
- Rare offerings: Gesha, anaerobic processing, experimental

**2. Aesthetic Differentiation**
