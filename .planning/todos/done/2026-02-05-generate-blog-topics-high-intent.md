title: Generate 30 high-intent blog topics and create markdown files for each
area: content
files:
  - docs/blog-topics/
---

## Problem

Need a content marketing strategy with 30 high-intent, high-volume search blog topics to drive organic traffic. Topics should target:
- Specialty coffee guides (brewing methods, equipment, techniques)
- Southeast Asia coffee story and origins
- Barista education and skills
- Roastery processes and technology
- Bean varieties, sourcing, and quality
- Coffee culture and industry trends

Each topic should be captured in its own markdown file for future content development.

## Solution

1. **Research phase:**
   - Use context7 MCP or web search to identify high-volume coffee industry keywords
   - Analyze search intent (informational, commercial, transactional)
   - Focus on Melbourne/Australia context where relevant

2. **Topic generation:**
   - Create 30 distinct blog topic ideas across the categories
   - Each topic should target specific search queries
   - Mix evergreen content with trending topics

3. **File structure:**
   - Create `/docs/blog-topics/` directory
   - One .md file per topic with structure:
     - Working title
     - Target keywords
     - Search intent
     - Outline/key points
     - Estimated word count
     - Internal linking opportunities

4. **Prioritization:**
   - Tag topics by difficulty (low/medium/high competition)
   - Estimate traffic potential
   - Identify quick wins vs. long-term authority content

**Research tools:** context7 MCP for coffee industry docs, web search for keyword research
