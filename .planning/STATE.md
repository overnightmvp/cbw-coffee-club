# The Bean Route: Project State

## Project Reference

**Building:** The Bean Route — 90-day coffee culture and marketplace authority hub with blog, internal linking strategy, SEO optimization, and free coffee growth loop.

**Core Value:** Drive organic discovery and vendor acquisition through high-intent content.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 01-Chadstone-Deep-Dive
**Current Plan:** 2 of 4
**Status:** In Progress — Content infrastructure validated, venue spotlights next

**Progress:** [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Recent Decisions

- Payload CMS selected for blog backend (allows non-dev publishing)
- 90-post strategy: 30 venue spotlights, 20 location guides, 15 how-to guides, 25 coffee education
- Geographic phases: Days 1-30 (Chadstone), 31-60 (Knox/Notting Hill/Bentleigh), 61-90 (expansion + meta)
- 1 post per day target for consistent SEO signal
- AI-assisted production with human refinement
- Free coffee incentive model for vendor acquisition
- **Phase 01:** RichTextRenderer already exists - no implementation needed (pre-existing work)
- **Phase 01:** 8/10 venues need verification - documented research gaps and next steps

## Blockers & Concerns

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Identified Risks:**
- **Venue Verification Gap:** Only 2/10 venues verified for spotlight posts (need 5+ minimum)
- **Venue Permissions:** Need to contact venues for permission before publishing spotlights
- **Geographic Scope:** Chadstone area may have limited mobile cart coverage, may need to expand suburbs

**Mitigations:**
- Complete Google Maps + Instagram research before Plan 01-02
- Create vendor outreach email template
- Expand to Box Hill, Monash, Wheelers Hill if needed

## Pending Todos

None currently tracked. Todos should be created when roadmap is broken into phases.
