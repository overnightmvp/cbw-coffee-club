    **SEO optimization per post:**
    - **Title:** "[Business Name]: [Specialty] in [Suburb] | The Bean Route"
    - **Excerpt:** 150-160 characters describing the vendor and event suitability
    - **Target Keywords:**
      - Primary: "[business name] coffee cart" or "[business name] [suburb]"
      - Secondary: "hire coffee cart [suburb]", "mobile barista [suburb]", "specialty coffee [suburb]"
    - **Internal Links (from linking matrix):**
      - 2-3 location guides (e.g., "Best Coffee Carts in Chadstone")
      - 1-2 how-to guides (e.g., "How to Hire a Coffee Cart for Your Event")
      - 1 coffee education post (e.g., "What Makes a Great Barista")

    **Content principles:**
    - Authentic and informative (not salesy)
    - Australian English spelling and Melbourne-specific references
    - Pricing in AUD (if available)
    - Event organizer perspective (benefits to hiring this vendor)
    - Include actionable next steps (book, inquire, get quote)

    **Image placeholders:**
    - Document required images for each post (vendor logo, coffee cart photo, latte art, event setup)
    - Note: "PLACEHOLDER: Vendor storefront photo" if image not available
    - Source from vendor Instagram/Facebook or use stock coffee images temporarily

    **Why markdown drafts first:**
    - Easier batch editing and human review
    - Version control before Payload entry
    - AI-assisted drafting with human refinement workflow
    - Can commit drafts to git for collaboration
  </action>
  <verify>
    - 10 markdown files exist in `docs/content-strategy/venue-spotlights/`
    - Each file is 800-1200 words (4,000-6,000 characters)
    - All posts include required sections (About, Menu, Pricing, Why Choose, How to Book)
    - Internal link placeholders match linking matrix
    - SEO metadata documented at top of each file (title, excerpt, keywords)

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Publish Spotlight Posts to Payload CMS</name>
  <files>
    (Payload CMS Posts collection - database entries, not files)
  </files>
  <action>
    Create 10 post entries in Payload CMS from markdown drafts, setting all fields correctly.

    **For each spotlight post:**

    1. **Access Payload Admin:**
       - Navigate to `/admin` (Payload CMS admin UI)
       - Authenticate with admin user (create admin user if not exists)

    2. **Create Post Entry:**
       - Click "Posts" collection
       - Click "Create New"

    3. **Standard Fields:**
       - **title:** From markdown frontmatter
       - **slug:** Auto-generated from title (lowercase, hyphens)
       - **excerpt:** 150-160 character meta description from markdown
       - **content:** Copy markdown body, convert to Lexical rich text format
         - Headings (H2, H3)
         - Paragraphs
         - Bold/italic formatting
         - Internal links (use Payload link format, not markdown)
         - External links (vendor profile links: `/vendors/[slug]`)
       - **featuredImage:** Upload vendor photo or use placeholder (document if placeholder)
       - **status:** 'published'
       - **publishedAt:** Set to current date/time (stagger by 1 day for publishing cadence)

    4. **Category & Conversion:**
       - **category:** 'event-focused' (all spotlights are event-focused)
       - **conversionGoal:** 'vendor_signup' (spotlights drive vendor discovery → inquiries)

    5. **SEO Fields:**
       - **targetKeywords:** Array of keywords from markdown frontmatter
         - Primary: "[business name] [suburb]"
         - Secondary: "hire coffee cart [suburb]", "mobile barista [suburb]"
       - **searchIntent:** "Find and book [business name] for events in [suburb]"
       - **metaDescription:** Same as excerpt (or custom if excerpt is too short)
       - **ogImage:** Same as featuredImage (or custom social media image)

    6. **Editorial Metadata:**
       - **priority:** 'quick-win' (venue spotlights are low-difficulty, fast ranking)
       - **difficulty:** 'low' (brand-name keywords are easy to rank for)
       - **trafficPotential:** 10-50 (low individual traffic, but aggregate value)

    7. **Internal Linking:**
       - **internalLinks:** Select posts from linking matrix
         - Note: Some target posts may not exist yet (location guides created in Plan 03)
         - Add available links now, update internalLinks field after Plan 03 completes
       - **relatedPosts:** Leave empty (auto-populated by category per Posts.ts)

    **Payload CMS workflow tips:**
    - Use draft mode first to preview content
    - Check Lexical rich text rendering in preview
    - Verify internal links resolve correctly (no 404s)
    - Set publishedAt dates in sequence (1 post per day cadence for SEO signal)

    **If Payload admin user doesn't exist:**
    - Create admin user via Payload CLI or seed script
    - Document admin credentials in secure location (not in git)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Navigate to `/admin` and authenticate successfully
    - Posts collection shows 10 published entries
    - Each post has:
      - status='published'
      - publishedAt date set
      - category='event-focused'
      - conversionGoal='vendor_signup'
      - targetKeywords array populated (2-3 keywords)
      - internalLinks field populated (at least 1 link, update after Plan 03)
    - Navigate to `/blog` - all 10 spotlights appear in "Event Planning Guides" section
    - Click any spotlight post - renders correctly with RichTextRenderer
  </verify>
  <done>
